# Surfsup-Analysis

## Project Overview
Investor W. Avy has requested a weather analysis of the island of Oahu to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop would be a sustainable year-round business venture. Specifically, he is looking for the following:

1. Temperature data for the month of June.
2. Temperature data for the month of December.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

## Results

 - Based on the images above, we can see some differences in temperatures between the two months:
      - On average, June has higher daily temperatures than December with a mean temperature of 74.94 versus December's 71.04.
      - Between the two, December has the lowest recorded temperature at 56 degrees while June's lowest temperature is 64.
      - On the other hand, June has the highest recorded temperature at 85 degrees while December's highest temperature is 83.
 
## Summary
In conclusion, the months of June and December don't seem to have dratiscally different weather temperatures, but in reality, the lowest and highest recorded temperatures for both months appear to be outliers. Since the average temperatures are above 70 degrees for both June and December, I would deduce that the surf and ice cream shop would be profitable year-round.

### Additional Analysis
Here are addtional tables for any further analysis of Oahu's weather for the months of June and December.
